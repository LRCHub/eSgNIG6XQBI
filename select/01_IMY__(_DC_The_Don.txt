Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ayo, Jug)
Woah, fah, fah, haha
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Go, go, go, go, go)

Uh, activated when I'm in town
Swerving wild, I can't concentrate
Girl, you can finally say I'm trippin' now
I don't even wanna stop, I ain't even tryna sit me down
Wait to know their love, but now they shootin' me down
When it's said and done, will they miss me now?
When I can't sing and they won't play me
Will you come around and listen now?
When I can't dance and my mind heavy
Will you pull up tryna lift me out?
I just wanna blast off, I ain't even tryna sit me down
Wait to know their love, but now they shootin' me down
When it's said and done I hope they miss me now, woah-woah

Go, go, go, go
Hit the stage like woah, woah, woah, woah
Out of mind like woah, woah, woah, woah
Let me call my bro, bro, bro, grr

This my re-up
I been flyin' so much, I need to get me a Visa
With a Bollywood star and we took a pill in Ibiza
And she talking too much, she hype now
She gon' fly now when I'm in it
I gotta give her back, she ain't mine now
Why would I ride in a rental?
And it's so viral to the rivals when I arrive and I'm in it
Now all the fans stormin', it's a tornado
Like a spiral when I'm in it
And we had to split up like the Jackson 5
But I'm Michael in this image
But I turned to an icon
So I'm legendary, so I'm so glad that we're finished

Uh, activated when I'm in town
Swervin' wild, I can't concentrate
Girl, you can finally say I'm trippin' now
I don't even wanna stop, I ain't even tryna sit me down
Wait to know their love, but now they shootin' me down
When it's said and done, will they miss me now?
When I can't sing and they won't play me
Will you come around and listen now?
When I can't dance and my mind heavy
Will you pull up tryna lift me out?
I just wanna blast off, I ain't even tryna sit me down
Wait to know their love, but now they shootin' me down
When it's said and done I hope they miss me now, woah-woah

Go, go, go, go
Hit the stage like woah, woah, woah, woah
Out of mind like woah, woah, woah, woah
Let me call my bro, bro, bro, grr

This my re-up
I been flying so much I need to get me a Visa
She been taking too long, I hate when they don't take it serious
Got a black card and a yellow card when I ride 'round
Now she curious
She stealing my swag with the typo
So if I go, she get furious
Shit, why the fuck is you mad?
She so predictable, bushes and grass
I been reading her mind like she made in a lab
She cannot trade me, ohh
My spider-senses keep on telling me something is off
'Cause the bitch act iffy
I think I feel poison ivy in my kidneys
Better tell her I ain't high off the shit, come get me

Uh, activated when I'm in town
Swervin' wild, I can't concentrate
Girl, you can finally say I'm trippin' now
I don't even wanna stop, I ain't even tryna sit me down
Wait to know their love, but now they shootin' me down
When it's said and done will they miss me now?
When I can't sing and they won't play me
Will you come around and listen now?
When I can't dance and my mind heavy
Will you pull up tryna lift me out?
I just wanna blast off, I ain't even tryna sit me down
Wait to know their love, but now they shootin' me down
When it's said and done I hope they miss me now, woah-woah

Go, go, go, go (When it's all said and done, where are we?)
Hit the stage like woah, woah, woah, woah
(When I can't dance and my mind heavy, yeah)
Out of mind like woah, woah, woah, woah
(Off the drugs, took a pill in Ibiza)
Let me call my bro, bro, bro, grr
(But we fucked up, it's just you and me)
