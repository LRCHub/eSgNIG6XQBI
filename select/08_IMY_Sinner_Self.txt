Can someone tell me if I am still sane?
Days getting longer while I cry in vain
Walking in a circle not able to feel
I curse everything that seems to be real

Stop this
Pain in my chest
Help Me
Find myself again

When I tried to see
What is wrong with me
I have found my soul
Crucified on the wall

You left me to suffer and feel alone
Am I not worthy to hold your hand?
Unspoken thoughts are all what you have left
Liar! What have you done to me?

Why
Have you
Done
All this to me?

So close but yet so far away
So far away
Everything I've loved is now gone
Everything is gone!
May we meet again
Please come back to me

Tell me
What's going on?
What is wrong?
What have I done?
Is your love numb?

Even though
You know I'm messed up
You promised
You will never give up
Look at me now
I'm still searching for your face
Every day

Withering
Looking into mirror
I can't see myself
Without your presence
I'm but an empty shell
I can't believe

How hard I fell
You live in heaven
I suffer in hell
Believe or not
I'm gonna rot

Emptiness in my heart is all I've got
I miss your face
I miss your voice
Days without you
How I hate those

I
